# fim

Implements a number of parallel Frequent Itemsets generation algorithms using the Spark framework.

At the moment, supports command-line interface.
The 'scripts' folder contains an example script for each supported algorithm.
 
To see the list of supported algorithms, use '_--help_' option. <br/>
At the moment they are: FP_GROWTH, BIG_FIM, and FIN. <br/>
The FP_GROWTH one just uses the standard Spark implementation.

To see the list of available options for the chosen algorithm, use '_\<algorithm name> --help_'.
